Unity Project Manager
CS 338

ant build file: build.xml

to run:
ant build
ant run

all code is in: src
(didn't rename to proejct for the sake of eclipse and all that)

FileUtils from apache is used to find all the files with the proper extension. Downloaded it off the web.

I do not know what will happen if you run this on tux, but I imagine it will be looking for unity scenes 
for a while until it reaches the end of every file. I also doubt any unity projects exists on tux, but
I've been wrong before.

I changed the design to include the open button and removed the expanding jlist, because I figured the
amount of buttons could become far too large depending on the size of the game. To compensate I took
advantage of the JComboBox which is perfect for the exact issue. 

The one thing I wasn't able to put into the project which I wish i had the time to do so was sorting the
table entries by the date modified rather than the name. It is more than possible with the code and 
information inside of a Scene, but I didn't figure out the best way to go about it in time. So instead
I just sorted it by name. Should I ever go back to this project, that is probably where I'll start.

Any questions, feel free to email me at cfb43@drexel.edu
